# MinServer 2

## Why "2"?
The "MinServer 1", or the older version of MinServer, is [here](https://github.com/steambird1/MinServer-Old).

## Background
On Nov 2021, I decided to make a server application that easy to build and run, and it'll support file operation and user authorize/register in JavaScript to run directly on HTML page.
So that's it :)

## Install
You just need to extract files in latest release and just run `MinServer 2.exe` or compile it by yourself using Visual Studio 2017 or newer.

There are some help in `help.txt`. You can also read them by running `MinServer 2.exe --help`.
